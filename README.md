# saveJulie
A visual polymorphic programming game in order to learn algorithmic and programming basics, from visual algorithmic to code programming. Help the rescuer to save Julie lost on a glacier!

The scenario is quite simple and classic: a tourist was lost on a glacier. A rescuer must join her on crossing the glacier while following a safe route and avoiding crevasses and falling rocks from the walls of the surrounding mountains. The player must help the rescuer by describing the path to reach the person to be rescued.

For this purpose he conceives a algorithm that the rescuer will have to execute in order to find his way. This algorithm can be expressed in different forms: visual blocks (Blockly(, code of a program written in Javascript or Python. Whenever the player designs an algorithm in the form of visual blocks, he can see the corresponding code in Javascript or Python. Subsequently he can directly design and edit algorithms written in one or other of these programming languages.

Once the algorithm is formulated, whether it is in the visual form of blocks or in the literal form in Javascript, the player tests his algorithm to see if he can achieve the goal, namely to join safely the person to be rescued (Julie).

The game offers a series of glacier configurations (still to be designed) allowing to progressively discover the statement, the sequences of statements and the elementary control structures (loops, tests) as well as their nesting.

To note that the design of an executable program in textual language can be done at the moment only in Javascript, the Pyhton option has yet to be developed, by transcoding Javascript (web application developed in Javascript).

The project is only at the prototype stage and should be used to introduce the algorithm and programming into college classes. Help welcome :o)!
